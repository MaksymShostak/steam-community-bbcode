## Why

Describe the accepted task or Issue, the package consumer/contributor problem, intended
outcome and guardrails. R0/R1 can use this brief; R2/R3 use the prior accepted baseline.

## What changed

Summarize the focused implementation.

## Verification

- [ ] Relevant focused automated tests pass.
- [ ] Package, SDLC and setup checks pass; commands and gaps are stated.
- [ ] Relevant installed-consumer, hosted matrix, mutation or renderer evidence is
  recorded, with missing evidence distinguished from passing local checks.

Manual scenarios and evidence:

## Principles, review and security

Summarize naming correctness (including retained names with changed responsibility),
native reuse and consumer validation, rights/current-version research, and outcome
alignment. Record any specific prior shim override. Identify the exact reviewed
revision and required independent review/security evidence or unresolved gap.
Keep undisclosed security evidence in a restricted store. Remove spent task-owned
scratch; retain tests, accepted baselines and failure evidence with their consumers.

## Impact review

- API, CLI and installed-consumer compatibility:
- Source/provenance and serialized-output impact:
- Performance/allocation impact:
- UI/localization/documentation impact:
- Screenshots or recordings, when relevant:

## Known limitations

State any known limitation, or write `None`.
